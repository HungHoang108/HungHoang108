### Hi there, I'm Hung Evan ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm a full-stack developer trainee at Integrify with a strong background in e-commerce and a passion for building robust and scalable applications. My focus in the past year has been on honing my skills in JavaScript and ReactJS, and now I'm expanding my expertise to TypeScript, C#, and .NET. I'm excited to showcase some of my latest projects and experiments that demonstrate my abilities. As an eager learner, I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. Please feel free to explore my GitHub repositories and don't hesitate to contact me if you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work.
