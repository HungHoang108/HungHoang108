### Hi there, I'm Hung Evan ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!
As a full-stack developer with a background in e-commerce and digital marketing, I'm passionate about problem-solving and have been exploring coding to further my skills. My goal is to become a highly skilled software developer, with expertise in Reactjs, TypeScript, C# .Net, and Azure.
I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges, whether it's working on a new project or exploring a new programming language. If you're looking for a motivated and dedicated software developer, I would love to connect with you. Please feel free to email me at hung.evandev@gmail.com for further information or inquiries.
